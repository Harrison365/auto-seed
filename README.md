Hello. Clone this repo, npm i and run node autoseed.js

This will re-seed your db as long as the file is left to run every 5 minutes.

Change the 1 in this
`*/1 * * * *`
to 5 for every 5 minutes, 15 for every 15 minutes, etc.

Remember to alter the axios URL accordingly for your seminar group's API.

K thanks bye.
