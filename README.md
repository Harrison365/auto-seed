##Auto-Seeder

Hello. Clone this repo and run `npm i` then `node autoSeed.js`.

This will re-seed your nc-marketplace database as long as the file is left to run every 5 minutes.

In autoSeed.js:

- You can change the 5 in this
  `*/5 * * * *`
  to 6 for every 6 minutes, 15 for every 15 minutes, etc.

- Remember to alter the axios URL accordingly for your seminar group's API.

K thanks bye.
